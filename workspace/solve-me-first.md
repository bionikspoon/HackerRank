This is a special challenge to make you familiar with IO.

##Problem Statement
This is an introductory challenge. The purpose of this challenge is to give you a working I/O template in your preferred language. It includes scanning two integers from `STDIN`, calling a function, returning a value, and printing it to `STDOUT`.

The task is to scan two numbers from `STDIN`, and print the sum $A+B$ on `STDOUT`. The code has already been provided for most of the popular languages. This is primarily for you to read and inspect how the IO is handled.

**Note**: The code has been saved in a template, which you can submit if you want. Or, you may try rewriting it and building it up from scratch.

**Input Format**
_(This section specifies the Input Format.)_
Given _A_ and _B_ on two different lines.

**Output Format**
_(This section specifies the Output Format.)_
An integer that denotes Sum _(A + B)_

**Constraints**
_(This section tells what input you can expect. You can freely assume that the input will remain within the boundaries specified. As an example here given below, A and B will never be below 1 or above 1000.)_
1 &le; _A_, _B_ &le; 1000

**Sample Input**

    2
    3

**Sample Output**

    5


The above sample should be taken seriously. The input will be _2_ and _3_ in two separate lines, and the output should be just one number, _5_. You should not print any whitespace at the beginning of output (e.g. _"  5"_ or _"\n5"_), unless specifically asked for. Also, printing any extra non-whitespace characters such as _"The answer is: 5_" will result in a Wrong Answer, as the judging is done using diff checker.
